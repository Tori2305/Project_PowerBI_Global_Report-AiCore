    "#### 6. Slicer Tool\n",
    "- To implement the slicer tool functionality, I created a dedicated pop-up panel that matches the color scheme of the    rest of the report but is slightly wider than the original panel. This pop-up includes two slicers: one for product category and one for country. Both slicers are configured with no background and adjusted to align in size and font with the overall design of the report, ensuring a consistent visual flow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- For the slicer settings:\n",
    "   - Product Category Slicer: This slicer allows the user to select either a single product category or multiple categories. I’ve kept the “Multi-Select” option enabled and left it without the \"Select All\" option to ensure users can choose multiple categories.\n",
    "   - Country Slicer: This slicer allows the user to select a single country or multiple countries. To enhance user experience, the “Show ‘Select all’ option” and “Multi-Select” settings are enabled, so users can quickly filter by one or all countries.\n",
    "   - I added a Back Icon in the top right corner of the panel, which enables users to close the slicer panel once they’ve made their selections. This gives a clean and efficient way to navigate the report after filtering the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57baea52-a6cd-420b-a078-c87622698894)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Panel Design & Bookmark Setup:**\n",
    "- To make the slicer panel functional, I utilized Power BI’s *Bookmark* feature. Once the slicer panel is complete and opened, I created a new bookmark called “Slice Bar Open.”\n",
    "- After adding the bookmark, I went to the Selection Panel and hid all elements of the slicer panel (slicers, button, and shapes). This step ensures that the slicer bar can appear and disappear smoothly.\n",
    "- I then created another bookmark called “Slice Bar Closed” to manage the state of the slicer panel when it’s closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Functionality to the Icons:**\n",
    "- On the slicer icon button, I enabled the *Action* property in the *Format* pane and set it to trigger the “Slicer Bar Open” bookmark, which will open the slicer panel.\n",
    "For the Back Icon, I configured the Action to trigger the “Slice Bar Closed” bookmark, which will close the slicer panel when clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Slicer Tool:**\n",
    "- To use the slicer functionality, hold down the Ctrl key and click the slicer icon to toggle the panel open and closed. The slicer panel provides a clean and intuitive way for users to filter data by category and country, enhancing the interactivity and usability of the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final slicer tool setup provides a smooth user experience, making data filtering both easy and interactive.\n",

    "### 3d. Stores Map Page\n",
    "To enable regional store managers to track their performance against quarterly profit and revenue targets, I have created an additional page displaying the ${\\textsf{\\color{mediumseagreen}Profit YTD}}$ on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Map Visual\n",
    "- For the map visual, I used the built-in map panel and assigned the Geogrphy Hierarchy to the Location field. This hierarchy allows users to drill down through World Region, Country, and Country Region levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I added a ${\\textsf{\\color{mediumseagreen}Profit YTD}}$ bubble to the map, where the size of the bubble is proportional to the Profit YTD for each region. For example, you can easily spot that Europe has a larger bubble than the USA, indicating a higher Profit YTD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *map controls* are set to *Auto Zoom* for optimal viewing, while both the *Zoom buttons* and *Lasso button* have been disabled. The *map style* is set to Roads, providing a good contrast with the report's overall color scheme.\n",

    "#### 2. Slicer\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow users to filter the data by specific countries, I added a slicer at the top of the page. This slicer enables users to select from Germany, United States, or United Kingdom. I enabled the \"Select all\" option for easier selection, allowing users to toggle between viewing data for all countries or focusing on a specific one. Selecting United Kingdom drills down to display the data specific to that country.\n",

    "#### 3. Stores DrillThrough Page\n",
    "To make it easier for regional managers to track performance at the store level, I created a Drillthrough page. This page provides detailed insights into each store's performance and can be accessed by right-clicking on any store in the map visual.\n",
    "- The page is set as a Drillthrough in the *Format* Pane, with the *Country Region* set as the *field for drilling through*.\n",
    "- When users right-click on a store and select the drillthrough option, they are directed to this detailed page:\n",

    "- A Card visual at the top-left displays the name of the selected store.\n",

    "- Beneath this, I’ve added a YTD analysis section that includes:\n",

    "   - This revealed filter options for all other visuals, with two buttons: a filter and a none button.\n",

    "- **Customer Detail Page:**\n",
    "   - The Top 20 Customers table should not cross-filter with any other visuals. After selecting the table, I set None for all other visuals.\n",
    "   - Total Customers per Product Category should not affect the Customers Line Graph, so I set it to None as well.\n",
    "   - Total Customers by Country should cross-filter the visuals, so I ensured the filter button was selected for this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product Detail Page:**\n",
    "   - The Order vs Profitability Scatter Plot and the Top 10 Products table should not affect any other visuals. For both of these, I selected None for all other visuals.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### 2.Navigation Bar\n",

    "   - In *Button Style*, I set the *State* = \"On Hover\", changed the Icon Type to \"Custom\", and uploaded the newly colored icons.\n",
    "- I turned on *Action* and changed the *Type* to Page Navigation, selecting the corresponding page for each button.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Product Detail Page Bookmark Adjustment\n",
    "On the Product Detail Page, I updated the Bookmarks Bar to hide the navigation icons when the slicer bar was open, and make them visible again when the slicer bar was closed.\n",
